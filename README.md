# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection system is a software that's used to check whether the person in the provided image is wearing a mask or not.

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook for training and testing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for face mask detection. The model classifies images into two categories: with mask and without mask.
You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab without the need to set up the environment locally.

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of people wearing face masks or not. The model is trained on a kaggle dataset of face images with two classes:
1. with_mask
2. without_mask

The notebook provides step-by-step instructions for:
1. Loading and pre-processing the dataset.
2. Building the CNN model using Keras.
3. Training the model on the dataset.
4. Evaluating the model's performance.
5. Making predictions on new images.
